Initial config:

(https://opensearch.org/docs/latest/security/)

One admin and one less priviledged user (the app), authenticated with username & password.  Can then add LDAP protocol.


(https://opensearch.org/docs/latest/security/configuration/best-practices/)

Questions:

- Indexes stored inside container, or local external volumes mounted?


----------------------------------------------------
Can we authenticate app with client TLS certificate?
----------------------------------------------------
opensearchpy.OpenSearch is 'SearchEngine' - the client
opensearch_dsl is 'dsl'

opensearchpy.OpenSearch = opensearchpy.client.OpenSearch

Confirming path: invenio_search.config -> OpenSearch client:
	invenio_search.config.SEARCH_CLIENT_CONFIG contains dict(...), passed to
	OpenSearch (see invenio_search.ext._client_builder (:299)
						  

1.  Generate self-signed certs (in opensearch_client)
    (https://opensearch.org/docs/latest/security/configuration/generate-certificates)
2.  Configure cluster
    (https://opensearch.org/docs/latest/security/authentication-backends/client-auth/)
3.  Test with python client
4.  Configure second-site to use SSL certs
